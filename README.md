# Excel Gandalf (∩｀-´)⊃━☆ﾟ.*・｡ﾟ

This tool helps you reorganize the column order of multiple excel files at once.

The usage of the tool is rather simple, you only need to select an excel file you wish to use as a template.
After you load the excel, the header columns are loaded into the list. 
With the buttons, you can set the column order to your desire. After you are done with setting your order, you can click Next.
The application will ask you on which excel files you wish to apply this column order. Select the folder you wish to save your excel copies and you are done.

### Note
It is important that the template you are applying to your new excel files have the same columns as the template.
If you are trying to apply a template with columns which are not present in the excel(s) you are modifying, the application is likely to crash.

Please be aware of this issue! It will be fixed in later versions.

Have fun using it!
